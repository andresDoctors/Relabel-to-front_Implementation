# Relabel-to-front_Implementation

**Relabel-to-front** is a type of push-relabel algorithm used for solving the **maximum flow problem** in a directed graph. The maximum flow problem involves finding the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node in the graph, subject to capacity constraints on the edges.

The relabel-to-front algorithm has a runtime of O(V^3), where V is the number of nodes in the graph. However, it has been shown to be faster in practice than other push-relabel algorithms, such as the generic push-relabel algorithm and the highest-label algorithm.
